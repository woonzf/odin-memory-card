### Possible Improvements:

- Display Pokémon index and type on the card
- Introduce Endless difficulty since High Score currently feels pointless as the highest difficulty is only 12
- Or Time Attack mode where score is calculated based on how fast you complete a difficulty, for example: score = difficulty x time left
